# Working with Pandas DataFrames in Python

## Presentation of the DOAJ Articles data

For this lesson, we will be using Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) article sample data, available on [FigShare](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3409471). Download this zip
and extract it on your working directory on a meaningful location (e.g. create
a folder called *data/*)

This data set is a list of published articles. The dataset is stored as *.csv*
(comma separated values) files: each row holds information for a single article,
and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Title            | Title of the article               |
| Authors          | Author (or authors)                |
| DOI              | DOI                                |
| URL              | URL                                |

| Author_Count     | Number of authors of the article   |
| First_Author     | Name of the first author           |
| Citation_Count   | Number times it has been cited     |
| Day              | Day of publication                 |

## About (Software) Libraries

A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform
tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment
out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench for use in a project.
Once a library is set up, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.

## Pandas in Python

One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis library. 
Pandas provides data structures, produces high quality plots with [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and integrates nicely with other libraries that use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which is another Python library) arrays.

Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to
add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import
a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the
library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`.  An
example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.


~~~
import pandas as pd
~~~
{: .source}

Each time we call a function that's in a library, we use the syntax
`LibraryName.FunctionName`. Adding the library name with a `.` before the
function name tells Python where to find the function. In the example above, we
have imported Pandas as `pd`. This means we don't have to type out `pandas` each
time we call a Pandas function.

## Lesson Overview

For this lesson we will be using the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) article data.

We are analyzing the articles published in a particular field of study. The
data set is stored in *.csv* (comma separated values) format. Within
the *.csv* files, each row holds information for a single article.

The first few rows of our first file (articles.csv) look like this:

~~~

(quite difficult to read and interpret as it is...)

### We want to:

1. Load that data into memory using Python.
2. Calculate the average number of authors per article, for each publisher.
3. Plot this information.

We can automate the process above using Python. It is efficient to spend time
building the code to perform these tasks because once it is built, we can use it
over and over on different datasets that use a similar format. This makes our
methods easily reproducible. We can also easily share our code with colleagues
and they can replicate the same analysis.

# Reading CSV data using Pandas

We will begin by locating and reading our survey data which are in CSV format (comma separated values).
We can use Pandas' `read_csv` function to pull the file directly into a
[DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe).

## So what's a DataFrame?

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different
types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more)
in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the *data.frame* in
R. A DataFrame always has an index (0-based). An index refers to the position of
an element in the data structure.

First, let's make sure the Python Pandas library is loaded. We will import
Pandas using the nickname `pd`.  This is a common convention on the internet,
so if you look up Pandas usage, you will often see it this way.

~~~
import pandas as pd
~~~
{: .source}

Let's also import the [OS Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html).
This library allows us to make sure we are in the correct working directory. If
you are working in IPython or Jupyter Notebook, be sure to start the notebook in the
workshop repository.  If you didn't do that you can always set the working
directory using the code below.

~~~
import os
os.getcwd()
# if this directory isn't right, use the command below to set the working directory
os.chdir("YOURPathHere")

# note that pd.read_csv is used because we imported pandas as pd
pd.read_csv("articles.csv")
~~~
{: .source}

The above command yields the **output** below:

~~~
        id                                              Title  \

999       1  2015  
1000     11  2015  

[1001 rows x 16 columns]
~~~
{: .output}

We can see that there were 1,001 rows parsed. Each row has 11
columns. The first column is the index of the DataFrame. The index is used to
identify the position of the data, but it is not an actual column of the DataFrame.
It looks like  the `read_csv` function in Pandas  read our file properly. However,
we haven't saved any data to memory so we can work with it. We need to assign the
DataFrame to a variable. Remember that a variable is a name for a value, such as `x`,
or  `data`. We can create a new  object with a variable name by assigning a value to it using `=`.

Let's call the imported survey data `articles_df`:

~~~
articles_df = pd.read_csv("articles.csv")
~~~
{: .source}

Notice when you assign the imported DataFrame to a variable, Python does not
produce any output on the screen. We can print the value of the `articles_df`
object by typing its name into the Python command prompt.

~~~
articles_df
~~~
{: .source}

which prints contents like above.

## Manipulating our Articles data

Now we can start manipulating our data. First, let's check the data type of the
data stored in `articles_df` using the `type` method. The `type` method and
`__class__` attribute tell us that `articles_df` type is `<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>`.

~~~
type(articles_df)
# this does the same thing as the above!
articles_df.__class__
~~~
{: .source}
~~~
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
~~~
{: .output}

We can also enter `articles_df.dtypes` at our prompt to view the data type for each
column in our DataFrame.
* `int64` represents numeric integer values (`int64` cells
can not store decimals).
* `object` represents strings (letters and numbers).
* `float64`
represents numbers with decimals.

~~~
articles_df.dtypes
~~~
{: .source}

which returns:

~~~
id                 int64
Title             object
Authors           object
DOI               object
URL               object
Subjects          object
ISSNs             object
Citation          object
LanguageId         int64
LicenceId          int64
Author_Count       int64
First_Author      object
Citation_Count     int64
Day                int64
Month              int64
Year               int64
dtype: object

~~~
{: .output}

We'll talk a bit more about what the different data types mean later in [Data Types and Formats](/03-data-types-and-format/).

### Useful ways to view DataFrame objects in Python

There are multiple methods that can be used to summarize and access the data
stored in DataFrames. Let's try out a few. Note that we call the method by using
the object name *articles_df.method*. So `articles_df.columns` provides an index
of all of the column names in our DataFrame.

> ## Try out the methods below to see what they return.
>
> 1. `articles_df.columns`
> 2. `articles_df.head()` - Also, what does `articles_df.head(15)` do?
> 3. `articles_df.tail()`
> 4. `articles_df.shape` - Take note of the output of the shape method. What format does it return the shape of the DataFrame in?

## Calculating statistics from data in a Pandas DataFrame

We've read our data into Python. Next, let's perform some quick summary
statistics to learn more about the data that we're working with.
We can perform summary stats quickly using groups. But
first we need to figure out what we want to group by.

Let's begin by exploring our data:

~~~
# Look at the column names
articles_df.columns.values
~~~
{: .source}

which **returns**:

~~~
array(['id', 'Title', 'Authors', 'DOI', 'URL', 'Subjects', 'ISSNs',
       'Citation', 'LanguageId', 'LicenceId', 'Author_Count',
       'First_Author', 'Citation_Count', 'Day', 'Month', 'Year'], dtype=object)
~~~
{: .output}

Let's get a list of all the months that articles were published in.
The `pd.unique` function tells us all of the unique values in a column.

~~~
pd.unique(articles_df['Month'])
~~~
{: .source}

which returns:

~~~
array([11, 12,  8,  4, 10,  9,  7,  6,  5,  3,  2,  1])
~~~
{: .source}
Which show us that articles have been published in every month of the year.

> ## Challenge
>
> Create a list of unique ISSNs found in the articles data.
> Call it `publications` (Note: each publication has a unique ISSN).
> How many unique publications (ISSNs) are there in the data?
{: .challenge}

# Groups in Pandas
Our DataFrame has a mixture of String and Numeric types. Some of the grouping
operations work different for numeric types (e.g. calculating averages).

We often want to calculate summary statistics grouped by subsets or attributes
within fields of our data. For example, we might want to know the number of
articles published in each publication.

We can calculate basic statistics for all records in a single column using the
syntax below:

~~~
articles_df['Citation_Count'].describe()
~~~
{: .source}
gives:

~~~
count    1001.000000
mean        9.023976
std         1.655121
min         3.000000
25%         9.000000
50%        10.000000
75%        10.000000
max        10.000000
Name: Citation_Count, dtype: float64
~~~
{: .output}

We can also extract one specific metric if we wish:

~~~
articles_df['ISSNs'].unique()
articles_df['ISSNs'].count()

articles_df['Citation_Count'].min()
articles_df['Citation_Count'].max()
articles_df['Citation_Count'].mean()
articles_df['Citation_Count'].std()
~~~
{: .source}

But if we want to summarize by one or more variables, for example Language, we can
use Pandas' `.groupby` method. Once we've created a groupby DataFrame, we
can quickly calculate summary statistics by a group of our choice.

~~~
# Group data by Language
byLang = articles_df.groupby('LanguageId')
~~~
{: .source}

The Pandas function `describe` will return descriptive stats including: mean,
median, max, min, std and count for a particular column in the data. Pandas'
`describe` function will only return summary values for columns containing
numeric data.

~~~
# summary statistics for all numeric columns by Language
byLang.describe()
# provide the mean for each numeric column by Language
byLang.mean()
~~~
{: .source}

gives this output:

~~~
                    id  LicenceId  Author_Count  Citation_Count  Day  \
LanguageId                                                             
1           510.004090   1.052147      4.013292        9.137014  1.0   
2            52.533333   1.000000      3.333333        4.333333  1.0   
3           116.571429   4.000000      4.142857        4.000000  1.0   
4           112.000000   4.000000      5.000000        4.000000  1.0   

                Month    Year  
LanguageId                     
1            6.332311  2015.0  
2           11.000000  2015.0  
3           12.000000  2015.0  
4           12.000000  2015.0  
~~~
{: .output}

The `groupby` command is powerful in that it allows us to quickly generate
summary stats.

## Quickly creating summary counts in Pandas

Let's next count the number of articles for each publisher. We can do this in a few
ways, but we'll use `groupby` combined with a `count()` method.

~~~
# count the number of samples by publisher
article_counts = articles_df.groupby('ISSNs')['Title'].count()
~~~
{: .source}

Or, we can also count just the rows that have the ISSN "1420-3049":

~~~
articles_df.groupby('ISSNs')['Title'].count()['1420-3049']
~~~
{: .source}

## Basic Math functions

If we wanted to, we could perform math on an entire column of our data. For
example let's multiply all author count values by 2. A more practical use of this might
be to normalize the data according to a mean, area, or some other value
calculated from our data.

~~~
# multiply all author count values by 2
articles_df['Author_Count'] * 2
~~~
{: .source}


> ## Another Challenge

# Quick & easy plotting data using Pandas
